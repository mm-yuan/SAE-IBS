# SAE-IBS: Hybrid Autoencoder for Robust Population Structure Inference

```SAE-IBS``` (Singular Autoencoder generalized by an IBS similarity matrix), combines the strengths of traditional matrix decomposition-based (e.g., principal component analysis) and more recent neural network-based (e.g., autoencoders) solutions. I.e., it yields an orthogonal latent space enhancing dimensionality selection while learning non-linear transformations.
